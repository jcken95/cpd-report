activity_description: |
  I attended the NWL (Northumbrian Water) innovation festival for two days. I took part in two sprint workshops where we had to design a solution to a problem as part of a team.
  The first problem was tackling plastic pollution on rivers and canals. The second problem was monitoring energy usagage in water treatment works.

  In each day I worked with a team of people I didn't know to try to find innovative solutions to these problems by the end of the day.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In attending the innovation festival, I developed my ability to scope projects, work with new people and improved my communcation and presentation skills.
  I gave a presentation on one of the days about the work, thus improved my communication skills.
  I had to work with people who I was unfamilar with, so this was great for my confidence.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a consultant, I need to be able to scope projects and find potential solutions quickly for clients. Working on these rapid projects has improved my ability to do so.
