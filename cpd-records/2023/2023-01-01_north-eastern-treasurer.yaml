  I am the treasurer for my local RSS group (North Eastern).
benefit_to_practice: |
  Managing the finances of the local group has required good organisational skills to ensure that all payments are made promptly.
benefit_to_users: |
  The work I have done has enabled the local group to function.
  This has enabled the local statistical community to engage with each other, and learn from speakers.
