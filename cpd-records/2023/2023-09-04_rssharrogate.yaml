activity_description: |
  I attended the RSS annual conference in 2023, which was held in Harrogate.
  In addition to attendance, I organsised and chaired multiple sessions.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In attending the conference, I was exposed to multiple new areas of statistics and data science by attending research talks and workshops.
  I chaired sessions which was good for my critical thinking skills, I had to quickly think of interesting questions when the audience had no questions.
  Organising sessions is a great way to give back to the statistical community.
benefit_to_users: |
  Organising/chairing sessions has improved my organisational skills and critical thinking.
  I have also given back the community by organising two conference sessions and a workshop.
