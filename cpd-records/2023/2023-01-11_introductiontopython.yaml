activity_description: |
  I attended an Introduction to Python course run my Jumping Rivers, the company who I also work for.
  This was part of my onboarding process, to see how an in-person course is taught, and to expose me to Python.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I leared about the basics of Python. I have plenty of experience with R, but limited exposure with Python.
  The course covered some basic things such as data structures in Python, and an introduction to some more intermediate topics such as data visualisation.
  I also learned about how an in-person Jumping Rivers course is run. I watched the instructor, Myles, and noted how he regularly takes breaks and asks attendees questions to keep them engaged.
benefit_to_users: |
  As an R instructor, I am often asked about "R vs Python". Learning about the basics of Python has allowed me to answer these questions with more confidence.
  Watching an in-person course also gives me more confidence to deliver in-person courses myself. Having attended a course, I am now familiar with the process for in-person delivery.
