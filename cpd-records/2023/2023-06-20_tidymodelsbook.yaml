activity_description: |
  I worked my way through the book "Tidy Modelling with R". This book walks through the {tidymodels} collection of packages for machine learning in R.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Much of my statistical training is in classical statistics and Bayesian modelling. Reading this book has exposed me to many machine learning techniques and a general machine learning workflow.
  I am now familiar with the basics of the {tidymodels} packages.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a consultant, being familiar with a broad range of modelling approaches is important, as clients may as for almost anything. It is therefore important to understand the basics of machine learning.
  In the future, I will start to use {tidymodels}. This offers a clean, reproducible pipeline for creating models. This is is important to recreate results at a future date.
