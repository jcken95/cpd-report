activity_description: |
  My PhD supervisor asked me to provide cover for a lecture to Psychology students on advanced statistical methods.
  In particular, the lecture was on mediation analysis.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had never use or studied mediation analysis before, so I had to learn the material to then teach it to the students.
  I read the lecture notes for the course and worked through relevant examples. I also read articles online to understand the applications of mediation analysis.
  Delivering the lecture also improved my communication skills as I have limited lecturing experience.
benefit_to_users: |
  Mediation analysis is a common used technique in medical and social science settings to investigate to understand how confounders may influence a statistical analysis.
  The students needed to learn about mediation as they may need to use it in their future careers, or at least be aware of how hidden variables and not accounting for mediator variables can lead to poor statistical findings.
