activity_description: |
  I was working on a project where I had to cluster thousands of time series.
  I had never done this before, so I read academic papers, blog posts, and use vignettes from R packages to learn how to cluster time series.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had some experience in clustering before, but I'd never clustered time series before and there were additional challenges such as missing observations in the time series.
  The client wanted me to place each of the time series into one of four categories, however, they were unlabel thus clustering methods had to be used.
benefit_to_users: |
  Time series is a common data format, which I had little exerience with. This gave me more confidence to work with time series data, which is useful for future clients.
