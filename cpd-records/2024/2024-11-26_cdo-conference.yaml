activity_description: |
  I attended an internal UKHSA conference, CDO (chief data officer) conference.
  I went to various talks about previous and ongoing UKHSA projects where data is critical to the solution, as well as talk about the future of data in UKHSA.
  I also gave a presentation about some of the work I've been doing on increasing the audience of our main forecasting products, as well as networking with colleagues across the organisation.

benefit_to_practice: |
  Attending organisational conferences is a great way to understand the wider goings on in UKHSA to better put my own work into the context of the organisations priorities and goals.
  It's also really useful to meet colleagues in person and build a connection with colleagues, as I am fully remote.

benefit_to_users: |
  Giving a presentation about the work I do increases the visibility of my team's work and techincal capabilities, which helps us find more work in the future.
  I also had technical conversations with colleages, sharing about the work we do in the organisation.
