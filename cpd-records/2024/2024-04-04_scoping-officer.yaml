activity_description: |
  officer in an R package for generating Microsoft office documents from R. This allows the user to, for example, generate a reproducable powerpoint presentation using a powerpoint template.
  I scoped the use of {officer} to automatically generate powerpoint presentations, and developed a small prototype presentation with the officer package.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I have limited experience with MS office products, having been a linux/open source user for most of my career to date. I learned about how to make an powerpoint template using the slide master and then use {officer} to generate a presentatation.

  In the winter period, the team I work in generates analyses on a weekly basis and produces a standardised slide pack for customers across our organisation.
  Automating the slide pack would save us a lot of time over the winter period and reduce human error as the current process involves a lot of copy-and-paste of graphs, tables and other quantities of interest.
