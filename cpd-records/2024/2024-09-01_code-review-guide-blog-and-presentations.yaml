activity_description: |
  I took the findings of my internal code review guide and wrote them up as publically available [blog post](https://jcken95.github.io/projects/code_review.html).
  To construct the post, I needed to refresh myself on how to manage my quarto website/blog. I also needed to re-write my original internal document to appeal to a general purpose data science/analyst audience.

  The post was successful which lead to two invited talks: one for a UKHSA monthly data scientists meeting, and another for a ONS coffee and code session. This meant I had to re-write the material again to make it suitable for a presentation rather than written format.

benefit_to_practice: |
  Writing a blog post is a different medium and it's good to practice different communication styles and reach new audiences.
  It was also good to talk about highly techincal problems such as code review, github and commits in a fairly informal way. This helps me to better explain these concepts to people, and makes me view them in new, more intuitive ways.

benefit_to_users: |
  Writing the blog and delivering subsequent presentations has made this content available for many others to learn from and bring to their own teams with appropraite adaptations.
  I had pitched a lot of the content at those in data roles, rather than general software development, so these techniques are more likley to become available to this communuity.
