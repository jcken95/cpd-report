activity_description: |
  I attended a two day course on Bayesian meta analysis with Stan, run by Robert Grant/RSS.
  The course covered the theory of Bayesian meta analysis, as well as the practical implementation through R and Stan.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I've never done any meta analysis before, so this was a great introduction to leaning how to combine the outputs of many studies.
  This was also a good opportunity to learn some Stan tips, like creating bespoke distributions.
benefit_to_users: |
  Improving my Stan skills means I can write better/more robust code which improves our products for customer/stakeholders.
  Learning about (Bayesian) meta analysis means I could now begin to aggreate studies; this would be useful for us a time-to-event context. For example, performing inference about the amount of time an individual spends in hospital with a given disease.
