activity_description: |
  I constructed a code review "best practice" guide for internal use within my team.
  To construct the guide, I read blogs, primarily from software developers / large organisations (e.g. GitLab, Stack Exchange). I tailored the findings to that of my team who are data scientists, not developers.


benefit_to_practice: |
  Code review is a critical part of our quality assurance process. This enncouraged me to think about my own approach to code review (and reviewing other forms of work) in a way which addresses concerns but is positive and maintains good relationships with colleagues.
  This helps us to have high-quality outputs, but also have good team morale.

benefit_to_users: |
  The guide is helpful to existing, and new, team members to help them understand why we do code review and how to provide code review in a way which is positive and encouraging.
  Part of developing the guide was a team discussion about the "rules" we should follow when reviewing code. This encouraged others to go through a similar process to me in learning about positive feedback.
  The development of the guide has enabled us to challenge one another, without being confrontational.
