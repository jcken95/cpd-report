  I attended the RSS annual conference in 2024, which was held in Brighton. I went to multiple talks and workshops, including a plenary from Hadley Whickham (Posit), professional delveopment sessions and technical talks, including a session on infectious disease modelling  -- highly relevant to my area of work.

  In addition to attendance, I volunteered at conference (speaker desk, helping to organise talks/speakers) and also gave a presentation about the work we do on winter hopsital pressures at UKHSA.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Keeping up to date with a wide variety of areas of statistics and data science is important -- many methods are applicable in different areas.
  By giving a (non-technical) presentation, I improved my understanding of our own products, and also this lead to several converstations with cross-government colleagues in other public health organisations.
benefit_to_users: |
  Volunteering at the speaker desk helps the conference to run smoothly, allowing others to get the most out of conference, it's good to give back.
  Connections made at conference lead to conversations after the conference to talk about out methodologies with other public health bodies, allowing for cross-government collaboration and knowledge exchange.
