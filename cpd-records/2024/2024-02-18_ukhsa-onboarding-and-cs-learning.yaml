  I attended training calls, watched videos and was assessed via quizzes about a variety of topics.
  This included training on safeguarding, data security, fraud and bribery, and minimising the environmental impact of my work activities.

  Being new the the civil service (CS), I now have a good understanding of CS expectations.
  The various training courses have made me more alert to how fraud/bribery and occur in such organisations and how to better handle sensitive data.
benefit_to_users: |
  Understaanding, and adhering to CS expectations ensures I am delivering analysis in an honest, factual way.
  This is important for stakeholders and customers, delivered analyses should not be influenced by personal opinion or ulterior motives.
