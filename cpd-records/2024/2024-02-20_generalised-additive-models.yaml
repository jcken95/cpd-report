activity_description: |
  GAMs (generalised additive models) are flexible regression models. We use them at UKHSA to flexibly model healthcare metrics over time.
  I read papers about GAMs in forecasting/nowcasting contexts, reviewed internal code and use/read documentation for {mgcv}; a popular R package for fitting GAMs.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had little exerience with GAMs and now/forecasting.
  This was a good opportunity to expand my statistical knowledge on both GAMs and now/forecasting.

benefit_to_users: |
  GAMs are simple and efficient for modelling complex processes.
  This combiniation of flexibility and simplicity means I am able to quickly produce appropriate models for healthcare metrics over time (e.g. patient numbers per day). This is useful in, for example, incident response where a stakeholder may need an analysis quickly.
  Our regular forecasts also rely on GAMs and {mgcv}, thus this means I am in a better position to maintain our codebase.
