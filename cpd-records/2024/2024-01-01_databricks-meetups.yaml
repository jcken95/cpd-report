  I have attended 1 Databricks user group meetup this year. The meetup incldes talks from a Databricks user/developer and networking with data scientist/engineers and tech workers in my local area.

  The talk I attended was an introduction to databricks. This included an explanation of Databricks, as well as a primer on data lake, warehouses and the "data lakehouse" and data engineering principles.
benefit_to_practice: |
 Learning about how large data volumes are processed in industry and learning about data engineering best practices is new to me.
 Networking with local tech workers is good; it's good to learn about what other people do, build a support network and haer new ideas.
