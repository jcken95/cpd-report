activity_description: |
  Attended an Introduction to Arrow workshop.
  I coded along, learning about {arrow} for accessing and manipulating larger-than-memory datasets.
  I also learned about some data engineering practices, such ways to store data to optimise queries.
  There was also an overview of data storage including colmnar format and parquet.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I've never used {arrow}, so it was good to learn a new package and learn data engineerin practices. I am trying to learn more about data engineering.
benefit_to_users: |
  I commonly have to access and use large amounts of data to develop products and construct deliverables for customers.
  Understanding how to manage large amounts of data means I can write better code for my colleages to use, and also allows me to work with new data sets, improving the deliverables for customers.
