activity_description: |
  This (operational) winter I am leading the management of our weekly rota for our weekly winter hospital pressures forecasting product for government and NHS customers.

  This involves many tasks, but includes organising the placement of staff on certain roles, quality assuring outputs and leading meetings to organise our efforts.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I've never taken a leading role in an operational activity before, I've usually found myself doing the "hands on" work. It has beeen useful to develop a style for team-leadership which could be useful in future roles.
  It's good to challenge myself and learn to be more comfortable delegating tasks to others.

  The winter hospital pressures forecasts are an increidbly important product for UKHSA and customers. An operational lead is critical to ensure the analysis is delivered in a timely manner to a high standard.
