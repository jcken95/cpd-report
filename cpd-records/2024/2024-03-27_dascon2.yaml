activity_description: |
  I sit in the DAS directorate within my department; this is our internal conference about how data and analytics are used to help protect the nation's health.

  I attended a variety of talks about data engineering, statistcal/data science methods and general strategy for the directorate.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I'm new to UKHSA so this was a good opportunity to see what's happening across the organisation/my directorate.
benefit_to_users: |
  Networking with/meeting colleagues will help with collaboration in the future.
  Gaining a better understanding of the organisation I work in helps me to udnerstand the needs of our customers/stakeholders.
