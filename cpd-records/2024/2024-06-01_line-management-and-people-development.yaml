activity_description: |
  This year I either line managed or acted in a technical leadership role to two colleagues; one was a graduate on a rotation ("A") and another was an early career research student on an internship in my team ("B").
  I held regular 1:1 meetings both A and B to do a variety of line management tasks such as: pair programming; managing workload; scoping projects.

benefit_to_practice: |
  It was a new experience for me to completely line manage someone and understand that I will reduce my techincal workload but our joint output would be better / more than my individual output.
  It was also useful to provide 1:1 pair programming to someone with less developed technical skills, I learned a lot about being patient, understanding and worked in a way aimed to help the individual solve problems on their own as much as possible, whilst managing deadlines.
benefit_to_users: |
  Both A and B benefited from my coding experience, approach to task management and ability to scope projects and make a decision on when to avoid certain tasks or appreciate that work was "good enough" and did not need more doing, and to focus on other tasks to meet deadlines.
  Other colleages benefitted from their productivity, and by providing techincal guidance I freed up the time of others to move on with pressing tasks.
