The goal of cpd-log is to track my continuous professional development. This is basically a diary. Take a look [here](https://jcken95.github.io/cpd-report/cpd-report.html).

I've used the CPD records of [Rhian Davies](https://github.com/StatsRhian/professional-development/) as a template for this, and also used her (levelup)[https://github.com/StatsRhian/levelup/] R package.
