  Writing my PhD thesis and publishing and academic paper which covered some aspects of my thesis.
  I discusses with my PhD supervisors how to structure a long, technical document, I developed skills with the LaTeX typesetting language by reading articles online and learned how to publish an academic paper by submitting an article.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had written lots of short reports in the past for my first degree, and wrote lots of short reports for my PhD.
  I had never written a very long document before or thought about how to structure such a document.
  Further, I had never published a paper before. Both of these tasks involved learning how to communicate complex mathematical and statistical findings without error.
  Writing up these findings and publishing them in a paper or thesis allows for other to build upon my work and further statistics as an academic discipline.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a PhD student, the thesis is a critical component of my course. It will remain in the university library for other to read and build upon in the future. Future researchers may find my thesis is a useful resource.
  The paper I co-published allows other researchers from a variety of disciplines to understand and use my findings. This may help them further their own research.
