activity_description: |
  Learning how to use R Markdown to create automated, technical reports.
  This was done in a practical way by writing reports, and using existing reports to understand the syntax.
benefit_to_practice: |
  R Markdown allows code, data and text to be linked together.
  This produces a reproducible workflow for creating reports and presentations.
benefit_to_users: |
  R Markdown provides a transparent, reproducible way to share your statistical findings.
  Whilst working as a consultant, this means that the client can see the inner workings of the document and understand the statistical methods behind a generated report.
  Further, since code is integrating into an R Markdown report, making changes to, for example, graphs as per the client request is as simple as modifying the graph. Re-rending the report will automatically pull through changes.
