activity_description: |
  Interrupted time series (ITS) is a statistical method for investigating the effect of an intervention on a population.
  It is useful when randomisation is not suitable or possible. I used ITS to investiate how patient outcomes changed before and after certain treatments became available.

benefit_to_practice: |
  I'd never used ITS before, and all my previous work with time series was based around ARIMA modelling. I'd only fit models for time series based on the Normal distribution.
  I read papers and articles to learn about the mathematics of ITS and the pros and cons of ITS. I read additional articles about Poisson time series as my application was for count data.
  I also learned about the {countts} package for analysis of time series where the observations are count data (Poisson, or Negative Binomial distributed).

benefit_to_users: |
  The ITS analysis was asked for by a client and critical to their understanding of the effect of treatment availability on a rare disease.
  This has allowed me to learn about different type of time series analysis which will be useful in future client work.
