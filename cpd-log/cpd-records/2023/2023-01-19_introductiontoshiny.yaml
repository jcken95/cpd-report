activity_description: |
  I attended an Introduction to Shiny course run my Jumping Rivers, the company who I also work for.
  This was part of my onboarding process, to see how an online course is taught, and to expose me to Shiny, an R package for creating dashboards.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I learned about how to create a dashboard in R using the {shiny} package. I build up a dashboard during the course to display information about flights from an airport.
  The course also touched on topics such as HTML and web accessiblilty (for those with visual impairments).
  Attending the course was also part of my onboarding process at Jumping Rivers, so I watched the trainer to see how they would deliver an online course.
benefit_to_users: |
  Shiny is a popular framework for building dashboards. Learning the basics means I can start to build my own dashboards for clients in the future.
  Watching the trainer deliver the course also increased my confidence in delivering online courses at work.
