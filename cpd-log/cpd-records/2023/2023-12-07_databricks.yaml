  I attended the December 2023 Newcastle Databricks meetup. Databricks is a platform which is used for managing data, deploying models and other data related tasks at scale.
  Thor List gave a talk about how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI will shape the future of data science. He also spoke about what Databricks is and how a data team can use Databricks.
benefit_to_practice: |
  LLMs such as ChatGPT are a hot topic at the moment. I learned about how they could be used in the future as a "co pilot" for a data scientist writing code.
  I also learned about when Databricks might be used in an industrial setting.
benefit_to_users: |
  Databricks is used by many clients, thus understanding the basics of its use case will allow me to better scope projects.
  Learning about generative AI is important for my teaching. Course attendees sometimes ask me about technologies such as ChatGPT, and understanding its limitations will help me to answer their questions.
