activity_description: |
  Learning about the tidy eval framework for programming with the tidyverse.
  This was achieved by contributing to an R package which analysed rare disease data from a healthcare registry.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I have some experience with the tidyverse for data wrangling, but I'd not done much programming with the tidyverse before.
  When creating an R package which relies on the tidyverse ({dplyr}, {ggplot2}, etc), the tidy eval framework (a collection of special operators) allow you to pass data variables as function arguments.
  This is useful if you want to, for example, create a function which plots two column variables.
  I used tidyeval in this project to write data wrangling functions to analyse the healthcare registry data.
benefit_to_users: |
  As an R developer, the tidyeval framework allows for flexible and robust programming within the tidyverse pacakges.
  This is important for client work, flexible code ensures that making changes as per client requests is as seemless as possible.
