activity_description: |
  Learning to use Git as a part of a team. I learned to use Git from the command line to create new branches, resolve merge conflicts
benefit_to_practice: |
  When making changes to a code-based project, Git allows you to track your changes. One way to improve the process further is to create a new "branch", a clean copy of the code and work within this branch.
  Once happy with the changes, the branch is "merged" into the main code base.
  When previously using git, I would always work directly with the main branch. This is a new way of working for me.
benefit_to_users: |
  This workflow, namely working from branches, allows me to experiment with the code and analysis in a way that is not destructive.
    Since I am working for a client as an intern, this workflowlets me ensure there is always a "clean", ready-to-go version of the code available for the client.
