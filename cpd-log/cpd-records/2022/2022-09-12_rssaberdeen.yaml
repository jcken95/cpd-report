  I attended the annual RSS conference, which was held in Aberdeen.
  I went to a variety of sessions/talks including "Technical presentations are hard!" by Nicola Rennie and Simon Wood's keynote talk.
  I also gave two talks: a rapid fire talk and a talk about being involed in the Young Statisticians Section.
  I organised  and chaired two sessions: "Statistics of Strange Species" and "Statistical careers in Environment and Engineering"

  Amongst other sessions, these sessions taught me about recent advances in statistical methods as well as developing transferrable skills such as presentation techniques.
  In organising sessions, I developed organisation and planning skills. Chairing the sessions developed my ability to ask critical questions of work, as I had to think of questions when the audience had none.
  This is an excellent networking opportunity, which helps me in my career but also supports my work with the Young Statisticians Section. I meet lots of potential speakers for future events at conference.

  As a PhD student in statistics, keeping up to date with statistical methods and practice is important.
  Presenting about being in the RSS helps other early career statisticians understand the benefits of being involved in a professional body.
  My rapid talk improved my communication skills which as an academic, are critical to sharing my findings.
  In organising and chairing sessions, I enabled other to learn about unusual and practical applications of statistics.
