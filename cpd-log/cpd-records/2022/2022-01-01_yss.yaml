activity_description: |
  I serve as an ordinary member of the Young Statisticians Section.
  I organise a variety of events, such as the Secret Statistician event and lead the sections social media accounts.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Being a member of the YSS involves organsing events, running the social media and engaging with other early career statisticians to support their development.
  Each of these activities improves my communication, organisation and confidence.
benefit_to_users: |
  Volunteering as a PhD student shows potential future employers that I am committed to the profession.
  Further, organising events through the YSS allows fellow early career statisticians to explore their own career options.
