activity_description: |
  In my free time, I respond to queries on crossvalidated.com - a forum for asking statistical and data science questions.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Responding to technical queries in a written format can be challenging. I improved my written communication by responding to queries.
  Some of my responses required me to research statistical methods/results, broadening my statistical knowledge.
benefit_to_users: |
  As an academic transitioning to consultancy, learning to explain a variaety of topic to people from various technical backgrounds will help me communicate my findings to future clients.
