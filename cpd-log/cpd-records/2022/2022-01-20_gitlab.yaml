activity_description: |
  Learning to use GitLab for making changes to code and planning future work; using the issue board; submitting and reviewing merge requests.
benefit_to_practice: |
  At JR, where I am an intern, changes to code for an analysis must be reviewed by another team member. Issues are used to plan future work and record problems with the code/analysis.
  I learned how to use these tools, and use GitLab to respond to code review to quickly implement code suggestions from a reviewer.
benefit_to_users: |
  High quality code, which has been reviewed, is essential for production ready analysis and allowed for efficient feedback.
  Further, learning these tools has enabled me to provide code review for the team I work with, and flag problems in a structured way.
