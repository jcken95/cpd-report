activity_description: |
  I worked as a maths-aid tutor for Newcastle University, providing 1-1 mathematical and statistical support for students who were not studying for a maths degree.
  Sometimes the work is on a drop-in basis and other times by appointment. The requests cover everything from "how do I calculate a percentage?" to "what test makes most sense for my data?" to "how do I solve this differential equation?".
benefit_to_practice: |
  I am a confident theoretical statistician, often working with very complex topics and talking to other statisticians.
  Working in Maths-Aid allowed me to practice explaining a variety of topics to those who had a very different techincal background to myself.
  This will help me in future employment opportunites and I will be regularly dealing with non-technical stakeholders, to who I will have to communicate my statsitcal findings in a simplified manner.
  I also learned about many areas of statistics which are not covered in a typical mathematics degree. For example, APA styling for statistics in Psychology, some non-parametric tests and experience with SPSS.
benefit_to_users: |
  The students gained confidence in their mathematical and statistical abilities as I provided them with support in their studies.
  By developing a broad knowledge of mathematical statistical methods, I will be better at being able to quickly identify appropriate approaches to data-driven problems.
