activity_description: |
  In 2023 I chaired the Young Statisticians Section of the Royal Statistical Society.
  I chair meetings, managed workloads and set a direction for the section.
  I was responsible for managing the time of around 10 volunteers.
  I also undertook ordinary memeber duties. This includes organising webinars and conference sessions.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Prior to chairing the YSS, I have never managed individuals or a team. I have begun to develop a management style which could be used in future roles.
  I also engaged in organising events and conference sessions. This has improved my organisational skills.
  The YSS is an excellent networking opportunity. I've greatly expanded my network by joining the YSS.
benefit_to_users: |
  In chairing the YSS I have given back to the statistics/data science community which has supported me.
  I have enabled events to go ahead which support early career statisticians and data scientist, and supported the development of my fellow committee members.
  In the future, I'll take the management and organisation skills I've develeoped into work settings. For example, planning projects.
