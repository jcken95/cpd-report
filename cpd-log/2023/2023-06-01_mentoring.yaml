activity_description: |
  I spent several hours mentoring a junior colleage on handful of projects.
  This included providing them with code review, statistical support and organising their workload.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In mentoring my junior colleague I've begun to develop a management/mentoring style, become better and planning and understanding the stregths and weaknesses of others.
  I'm trying to balance providing support without doing all the work myself.
benefit_to_users: |
  Providing this mentorship will help me on future client projects. I feel more comfortable and confident in directing other having mentored my colleague.
